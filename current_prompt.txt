Analyze how well this CV matches the job description.

APPROACH:
Read the job description and identify what it emphasizes:
- "Essential", "Required", "Must have" vs "Desirable", "Preferred"
- What gets detail or is listed first
- Job title and industry context

Assess match based on THIS JOB's priorities:
- Formal qualifications essential → weight heavily
- Technical skills focused → emphasize relevant experience
- Industry/domain experience emphasized → prioritize sector knowledge
- Leadership required → assess management background

PRINCIPLES:
- Match scoring to job's stated priorities
- Missing essentials significantly impact score
- Don't conflate different professional disciplines (e.g. technical skills ≠ formal qualifications)
- Consider realistic hiring probability

Provide brief analysis (2 paragraphs):
1. Job's critical priorities and candidate match
2. Key gaps affecting selection chances

End with: Score: N (0-10)

Scoring (use full range, most 3-6):
0-2: Unsuitable (wrong field, missing critical requirements)
3-4: Poor (lacks key priorities, major gaps)
5-6: Average (meets some requirements, notable gaps in priorities)
7: Good (meets most priorities, only minor gaps)
8: Strong (exceeds requirements in key areas)
9: Excellent (significantly exceeds expectations)
10: Perfect (ideal candidate)
